# Scopulus vir
A game seeded from my imaginations during my high school years, when I first became captivated by the programming world. Written in Java.

Last update to the game was June of 2013 -- of my senior year in high school.

### Will this be updated in the future?
You certainly bet it will. It was a serious passion of mine in high school, and I think the younger me would really appreciate how much I and future self can push the limits of this project. The code is somewhat complicated, untidy, and could be simplified and optimized. This will all be taken care of in what will be known as the 2.0 version -- the reboot.

### Will it be kept as text based?
Yes. With a cleaner feel.

### Do you play computer games?
I used to (heavily). Now, I don't find too much entertainment in them. However, I love the concept of storytelling, and being able to derive a product from an imagination, from a will and a drive.
